/**
 * Data transfer record carrying Mission Participant payload. The {@code orgUnits} list carries the
 * participant's affiliations (zero, one, or several org units — a Staffel and/or Spezialkommandos),
 * replacing the former single {@code squadron} field so a member of both a Staffel and an SK has
 * both badges rendered on the roster.
 *
 * <p>A row with no {@code user} is an <em>external</em> participant — a named person without an
 * account, recorded by the mission leadership (ADR-0159, decision D4). It used to carry a {@code
 * guestEditToken}: a per-row capability token handed to an anonymous creator so they could edit
 * their own sign-up without a login. There is no anonymous sign-up left to mint one for, and V239
 * dropped the column that stored its hash.
